        <p> Due to COVID-19, we are following protocols to keep our instructors, dancers and their families safe and
            healthy. We will maintain these same guidelines for our open house. All instructors present will be wearing
            face coverings and anyone entering the studio will be required to do the same. We will also limit the number
            of people in our lobby at any given time in an effort to encourage social distancing. If you would like more
            information, call us at 8917206636.</p>
